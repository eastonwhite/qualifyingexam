# Dissertation proposal

Here I have included notes and thoughts for my PhD qualifying exam which ~~is scheduled for Dec 1st (38 days away)~~ is now finished. My committee consisted of:

  - Chair: Sebastian Schreiber
  - Population biology: Marissa Baskett
  - Dynamic modeling: Louis Botsford
  - Environmental stochasticity: Louie Yang
  - Conservation biology: Ted Grosholz

This repository was originally inspired by Noam Ross who also put his qualifying exam notes on Github.
