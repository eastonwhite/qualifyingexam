[Summary][1]
------------

-   Need to sacrifice at least one of generality, realism, and precision in a
    model, usually choosing as a results of goals of prediction, inference, and
    management


[Some Notes on My Approach][1]
==============================

-   Interested in prediction and inference, but generality only as much as
    required for scenario-building.
-   Best to mix model structure that improves prediction and allows for
    inference with non-parametric components (splines, S-maps)
-   Choose structural components based on (a) inferential question, (b)
    management options, (c) data availability. e.g., include population
    structure when this is what managers can modify. Exclude genetic information
    because of inability to collect.
-   Test nonparametric components against pure stochasticity
-   Include observation as a model component
-   Parse out sources of uncertainty when possible
-   (More to come on this after reading the model selection literature provided
    by [Andrew Latimer])
