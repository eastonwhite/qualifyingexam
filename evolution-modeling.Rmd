For my second chapter, I have compiled a list of important papers and ideas regarding modeling evolution. Here a * means it was suggested by a committee member.

# Important papers

- more model description and purpose of haypiles
- Adaptive Dynamics (in ETE)
     -
- know Marissa's evolutionary modeling work
- re-read adaptive dynamics users' guide
- *[@Day2005] attached
- Levin & Muller-Landau 2000 attached for Fig. 1/general approach to the analysis (don't worry about the seed dispersal specifics)
- ESS vs NIS, different types of evolutionary endpoints
- Apaloo 1997 attached
